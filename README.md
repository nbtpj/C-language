# C-language
hi

This mini project I finished describes a very **SIMPLE GAME** written by [C++ programming language](http://www.cplusplus.com/) and using [the SDL library](https://www.libsdl.org/). Take a look and hope you enjoy it.

If you have any questions or feedback, you can *leave some comments* for me. I would be very happy to receive them and answer you as fast as possible.

> Since the coding game is not my major so there will be **no update** for this project. You are free to change and make use of my code. It is my pleasure ^^, hopefully they are useful enough.
