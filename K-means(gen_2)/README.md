**HI**

Because I did find some bugs in the previous one, I decide to upload this project.
This project is a little more specific than the last one, of course, without bug.

**What 's new?**
I explained more carefully in my code, so I believe they will much more easy to understand. ( hii, because the last one I did for my using )

**And where is the bug?**
If you have run the previous project, you will see, when your cluster does not have any point, the program will stop and return an exception. I remove this bug by rechoosing the centers until we get the better ones.
